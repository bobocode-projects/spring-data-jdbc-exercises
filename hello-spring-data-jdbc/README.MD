Get started with *Spring Data JDBC*
### Task
The task is to implement `AccountService` using `AccountRepository`.  In order to do that you need to **configure 
`AccountRepository` as Spring Data JDBC Repository**, **provide mapping for `Account` entity** and eventually **implement
the required methods.** Please follow the instruction in the *todo* sections. 

To verify your configuration, run `AccountServiceTest`

 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with *Spring Boot* and *Spring Data*
* Java 11 sdk 
* Maven
* Lombok plugin

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
